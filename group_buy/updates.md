# Updates for the Luddite Group Buy

## October 25, 2018
Everyone who joined the group buy and paid is now a full participant!

Using the funds we collected from the rolling invoicing, we've already ordered many items we'll need for the group buy kits. We prioritized purchasing items from places that take longer to ship, and items that were at risk of going out of stock.

The promised ETA of late January will definitely be met. We may be able to move up that date as well. The items that are the primary source of delays due to being out of stock are the plate stabilizers. They will only be arriving in late December, so those that ordered base kits without plates can expect an earlier ship date.

When setting up the group buy, we weren't sure if the plates would support PCB stabilizers. Having done the test build, I found out that the plates **DO** support PCB stabilizers. Given that the plate stabilizers are the primary source of delays, we're working out a system the allow those who ordered plates to get their orders earlier. More details to come on that later.

The build guide is almost ready, you can see it in it's current state [here](../build_guide.md). It's missing a few things, like socketing and flashing the pro micro. I'd also like to add some extra detail to some parts of the guide. I welcome any and all feedback - if there's anything unclear or you'd like to see added, please let me know.

I can be contacted on discord as Upas#2583, on reddit as /u/upas, or via email. I'm active in the mechkeys discord channel too.

Thank you all for joining the group buy! I plan on providing weekly updates here, even if the update is "nothing has really changed since last week", so check in whenever you can.
