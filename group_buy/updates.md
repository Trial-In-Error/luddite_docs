# Updates for the Luddite Group Buy

## October 29, 2018
Our PCBs and plates have shipped, along with electronic components! This was way faster than I expected - these should all be delivered in the next couple weeks.

I have good news on the plate stabilizer front as well - I was able to order some plate stabilizers and they should be arriving this week. We'll have enough to fulfill all the ordered plates, though I'm not sure there will be many extra. This means the ship date is definitely moving up from Late January. The items that will take the longest to arrive now are the Pro Micros and M2 hardware.

After putting together the build guide, the 6 standard Mounting holes have proven pretty solid for the sandwich keyboard. While there are 16 holes on the outside edge of the PCB, we'll be including 8-10 M2 standoffs and double that amount of screws in the base kit. Given how solid the 6 mounting holes are, 10 (which is 4 extra) should be more than enough. The 6 standard mounting holes are also accessible when the plate is used. That's not the case for any of the other holes, so if you ever think you might want to put your Luddite in a case, I highly recommend using only the 6 standard mounting holes for sandwiching your PCBs.

Speaking of cases, I also tested compatibility in a cheap plastic case. I've started a document to track case compatibility [here](../case_compat.dm). Feel free to submit a pull request to add any of your findings! There is also a google sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vfqxFTUa8v4VEHw5i9PEsweAgG-jUHJPKpPGdXEKyr4/edit#gid=0). If you add the information there, I'll move it over to the document on this site.

Thanks! You can expect the next update on November 5th, if nothing changes before then.

Everyone who joined the group buy and paid is now a full participant!

Using the funds we collected from the rolling invoicing, we've already ordered many items we'll need for the group buy kits. We prioritized purchasing items from places that take longer to ship, and items that were at risk of going out of stock.

The promised ETA of late January will definitely be met. We may be able to move up that date as well. The items that are the primary source of delays due to being out of stock are the plate stabilizers. They will only be arriving in late December, so those that ordered base kits without plates can expect an earlier ship date.

When setting up the group buy, we weren't sure if the plates would support PCB stabilizers. Having done the test build, I found out that the plates **DO** support PCB stabilizers. Given that the plate stabilizers are the primary source of delays, we're working out a system the allow those who ordered plates to get their orders earlier. More details to come on that later.

The build guide is almost ready, you can see it in it's current state [here](../build_guide.md). It's missing a few things, like socketing and flashing the pro micro. I'd also like to add some extra detail to some parts of the guide. I welcome any and all feedback - if there's anything unclear or you'd like to see added, please let me know.

I can be contacted on discord as Upas#8523, on reddit as /u/upas, or via email. I'm active in the mechkeys discord channel too.

Thank you all for joining the group buy! I plan on providing weekly updates here, even if the update is "nothing has really changed since last week", so check in whenever you can.
