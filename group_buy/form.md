The information below was contained in the form posted for the Luddite group buy. This is a verbatim copy:

```
This is the group buy form for the Luddite 2 PCB, developed by 40percent.club:
http://www.40percent.club/2018/08/luddite-2.html

By filling this form out, you are expressing intent to join the group buy and pay for at least one kit.

Options will be explained in detail in subsequent pages, but let's start with some disclaimers:

Group Buys are a method of sale similar to a pre-order. Payments are collected ahead of time in order to submit a bulk order to a manufacturer for production. Due to this, there is often an extended timeline from the order date to when the product is shipped out, with these timelines ranging from a couple weeks to several months. 

For this group buy, we're looking at the 2-4 month range. Our goal is to get kits shipped before Christmas, but shipping by the end of January or February is more likely. Unexpected delays can happen, and we make no guarantees of timeframe.

Refunds:

The nature of the GB process means that funds for refunds are not available after submission of the group payment to the manufacturer. Refunds may not be available after submission of your Group Buy order. Refunds will not be available after bulk order submission to the vendor. Refunds may be made available on a case-by-case basis at my discretion.

Invoicing:

Invoicing will occur on a rolling basis - they will be sent out daily. You will have 72 hours upon receipt of invoice to pay. 

If you dodge an invoice payment without notifying me ahead of time that you wish to adjust your order or drop your order, you may be blacklisted, at my discretion, from participating in this group buy. Incorrectly filling out form submissions intended for invoicing will lead to your order being removed from that form. 

Shipping information:

Normal shipping is done via USPS First Class Package bubble mailers CONUS. Shipping to Canada is also available, on a per-person basis. It will cost extra. Unfortunately, we will not support shipping to the EU or elsewhere for this Group Buy.

Non-commercial:

This group buy is being operated in a non commercial fashion. Extra kits will be bought to cover loss and mistakes. At the end of this group buy, any remaining kits will be given away to group buy participants, or to the general r/mk community. Our intent is to make prices lower for everyone by using bulk pricing - not to profit.
